# Kelly Criterion Exploration

> In probability theory and intertemporal portfolio choice, the Kelly criterion (or Kelly strategy or Kelly bet), also known as the scientific gambling method, is a formula for bet sizing that leads almost surely (under the assumption of known expected returns) to higher wealth compared to any other strategy in the long run

> For an even money bet, the Kelly criterion computes the wager size percentage by multiplying the percent chance to win by two, then subtracting one-hundred percent. So, for a bet with a 70% chance to win the optimal wager size is 40% of available funds.

This repo contains my work implementing the kelly criterion, specifically the case outlined in the second paragraph above, and other betting strategies and then doing a bunch of simulations with them.

The work in this repo is done with [the hy programming language](https://hylang.org/), a lisp that maps pretty closely to python.
